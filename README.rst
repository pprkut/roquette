Roquette is the music player for obsessive-compulsive music geeks, powered by
beets (http://beets.io/).

Roquette aims to build off of beets' excellent music collection management
features and provides a player utilizing everything beets has to offer. Be
it MusicBrainz, ListenBrainz, AcousticBrainz, Discogs or any other data
source available to beets, all the information is accessible from Roquette
so you can explore, filter and re-discover your own music.

Current Status
--------------

Roquette is currently in early development and is not ready for endusers yet.
It isn't even able to actually play music yet, so the most you can do with it
for now is browse your beets library.
